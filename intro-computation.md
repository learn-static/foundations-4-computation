# Introduction to Computational Methods

## Outcomes

After completing this module, one should be able to: 

- articulate the difference between a static site and a dynamic site
- understand the basics of how Jekyll generates content using the Liquid templating language and data files
- be able to recognize and edit Liquid code that uses the basic computational operations to present data in different views

## A Brief Introduction to Jekyll 

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static web generator that iterates over a directory of files in order to create a static website. A static site refers to a site that does not use a database to generate its content. This how the web used to work in the 90s and early 2000s. Most sites you use on a daily basis, especially social media and news/entertainment sites, are database-driven endeavors that create the site on the fly when you visit them. Jekyll creates the web site before you visit them, which makes them much easier to secure, load, and keep working. 

Note that both types of web "generators" -- static and dynamic -- use the concepts we'll explain below (variables, templates, for loops, and if-then statements) to create content for their site. Jekyll just does this work before hand.

For more on Static Sites and Jekyll, see [Evan's GitHub Pages Workshop](https://evanwill.github.io/go-go-ghpages-b/content/2-jekyll.html). For our purposes, it's enough to know that Jekyll works over a series of config files, content files (mostly written in Markdown), layout and feature templates (mostly written in HTML), and data files to create websites -- and these are often generated in repositories on GitHub and published via GitHub Pages. 

So with this module, and the step by step instructions below, we hope to bring all the previous modules into focus and demonstrate some more complex computational concepts to help you better understand how everything is working. 

## Variables

Variables are essential concepts in any computing language. They are, simply, a placeholder, that stands in for some value (a word, name, expression) that may change. 

Look up at the top-right corner of your screen. You'll see a circle representing your GitHub account with a graphic. This is the same for everyone who uses this site. So when the site is generated, the code has a **variable** in place that is able to pull in your specific image/avatar. 

## Template 

A template is typically mixture

Basic computational concepts with Liquid
- Syntax (how to write a command)
- Variables 
- Arrays
- Conditionals (flow control, if/else)
- Iteration (for loops)



Jekyll is a static site generator written in the Ruby langauge. Liquid is the templating language used by Jekyll to create data driven features.
